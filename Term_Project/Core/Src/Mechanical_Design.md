# Mechanical Design of a High Rate of Fire Nerf Blaster

## Overview

This document details the mechanical design of our high rate of fire Nerf blaster project. The design process involved precision CNC machining for critical parts, custom PCB development, and meticulous assembly to ensure high performance and reliability.

## CNC Machined Parts

The blaster features several CNC machined components that are crucial for its high rate of fire and durability. Below are images and descriptions of these parts:

### Part 1: CNC Base Plate

The flywheel housing holds the flywheels that accelerate the darts. It is designed to maintain alignment under high-speed operation, ensuring consistent firing rates.

## Custom PCBs

The electronics of the blaster are built around custom-designed PCBs, which control the firing mechanism and other functionalities.

The PCBs were designed to fit perfectly within the blaster's housing, providing reliable control over the firing mechanism and integrating with the CNC machined parts.

## Mid-Assembly Process

During the assembly process, we carefully integrated all the machined parts and electronic components.
