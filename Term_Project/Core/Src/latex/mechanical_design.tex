This document details the mechanical design of our high rate of fire Nerf blaster project. The design process involved precision CNC machining for critical parts, custom PCB development, and meticulous assembly to ensure high performance and reliability.\hypertarget{mechanical_design_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{CNC Machined Parts}{CNC Machined Parts}}\label{mechanical_design_autotoc_md3}
The blaster features several CNC machined components that are crucial for its high rate of fire and durability. Below are images and descriptions of these parts\+:\hypertarget{mechanical_design_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Part 1\+: CNC Base Plate}{Part 1: CNC Base Plate}}\label{mechanical_design_autotoc_md4}


The base plate is meant to act as a rigid mounting for a majority of critical components\hypertarget{mechanical_design_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Part 2\+: CNC Machined Trigger Mechanism}{Part 2: CNC Machined Trigger Mechanism}}\label{mechanical_design_autotoc_md5}


The trigger mechanism is engineered for fast response and durability. It integrates seamlessly with the electronic firing system to enable rapid-\/fire capability.\hypertarget{mechanical_design_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Part 3\+: CNC Machined Flywheel Housing}{Part 3: CNC Machined Flywheel Housing}}\label{mechanical_design_autotoc_md6}


The flywheel housing holds the flywheels that accelerate the darts. It is designed to maintain alignment under high-\/speed operation, ensuring consistent firing rates.\hypertarget{mechanical_design_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Custom PCBs}{Custom PCBs}}\label{mechanical_design_autotoc_md7}
The electronics of the blaster are built around custom-\/designed PCBs, which control the firing mechanism and other functionalities.





The PCBs were designed to fit perfectly within the blaster\textquotesingle{}s housing, providing reliable control over the firing mechanism and integrating with the CNC machined parts.\hypertarget{mechanical_design_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Mid-\/\+Assembly Process}{Mid-Assembly Process}}\label{mechanical_design_autotoc_md8}
During the assembly process, we carefully integrated all the machined parts and electronic components.



This photo shows the blaster in its mid-\/assembly stage, where critical adjustments were made to ensure all parts function together seamlessly.\hypertarget{mechanical_design_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Final Product}{Final Product}}\label{mechanical_design_autotoc_md9}
The final product is a high-\/performance Nerf blaster capable of a high rate of fire, thanks to the precision of its mechanical and electronic components.



The completed blaster not only performs exceptionally well but also features a robust and aesthetically pleasing design.
