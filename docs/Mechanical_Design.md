## Overview

This document details the mechanical design of our high rate of fire  blaster project. The design process involved many 3D-printed parts, CNC machining several key components, soldering components to our board, and assembling the blaster in its entirety.


## CNC Machined Parts

The blaster features several CNC machined components that are crucial for its high rate of fire and durability. Below are images and descriptions of these parts:

### Part 1: CNC Base Plate

The base plate is meant to act as a rigid mounting for a majority of critical components

### Part 2: CNC Machined Trigger Mechanism

The flags are attached to the solenoids, which trigger the beam brake sensors when extended or retracted.

### Part 3: CNC Machined Flywheel Housing

The flywheels are designed to house the brushless motors inside them. These were CNC machined due to the high speeds of the motors, which requires a higher quality flywheel.


## Mid-Assembly Process

During the assembly process, we integrated each component slowly verifying it works as intended both mechanically and in software.

This photo shows the blaster in its mid-assembly stage, where we were testing solenoids, flywheels, and beam brake sensor functionality.

## Final Product

The final product is a Nerf blaster that has 12 different modes, a safety switch, potentiometers for flywheel speed and solenoid fire rate adjustment, a user interface, and two triggers for both spinning the motors to speed and firing the darts.

The completed blaster, although not as robust as we would like, functions properly with little software issues. There is one issue with the beam brake sensors lifting due to the high vibrations of the solenoids, but a piece of foam inside the top cover solves this issue for the most part.
