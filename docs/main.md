The blaster has 2 barrels with two magazines loaded into it, allowing for one or both magazines to be used at once. The blaster also has solenoids designed for a high rate of fire application, and brushless motors controlling flywheel to launch the darts at high speeds.

The blaster has 12 different firing patterns available, based on both the firing modes and types. The firing modes include the individual left and right magazines, an alternating mode, and a mode where both magazines fire at once. The firing types include single fire, 4-round burst, and fully automatic. The blaster can be in any combination of modes using the user interface on the top of the blaster.
